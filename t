@CB#7571 I updated the site here : https://df.0x6664.com with:
1. All the feedback you sent me, except the tooltips, @exu#8346
2. The about page desktop version, the mobile is almost there, I'm trying to find a css only carroussel, a js solution would litter the markdown files with nested classes which I want to avoid.
3. The manifesto page.
4. The locale switcher, courtesy of @belle
5. The post listing pages, courtesy of @ella (Note the press page returns a 404 because we don't have any categorised press articles)
